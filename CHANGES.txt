0.9.0 --> 0.9.1
- Fixed error "self.read_cards_from_str() does not exist" (wrong function name)
- Fixed error with downloading images for certain cards with the double forward slash "//" in their 
  names resulting to illegal filename. Now the double forward slash can be replaced by a given string

- Improved handling paths for downloading images and creating proxy sheets with "pathlib"
- Spellchecking

0.9.1 --> 0.9.2
- Now using the common 'requests' library
- The 'id' attribute of sets is now correctly retrieved from Scryfall API instead of created randomly
- Updating is now more robust taking into account certain errors that are caused by inconsistencies of the API side.
  There are apparently situations where certain sets might be missing, might have wrong 'card_count' attributes or
  similar things that caused request errors and crashing
- Added more tests
- Added a method to check if the local Scryfall database is consistent. It checks things like all the cards belong in
  a set, no set or the full cards list has duplicate cards, etc.

- The updating methods that fetch only new card info are now deprecated. They raise a warning and just call the full
  update method, so any old code is not broken
- For simplicity, the names of methods 'full_update_from_mtgio' and 'full_update_from_scryfall' have been changed to
  simpler 'mtgio_update' and 'scryfall_update'. Calling the old functions will just raise a warning and call the new
  functions, so any old code is not broken

0.9.2 --> 0.9.3
- Removed the eur, usd and tix fields
- Added prices field which contains eur, usd and tix
- Added multiverse_ids field

0.9.2 --> 0.9.3
- Added the ability to include any card-specific keyword arguments such as lang='en' for reading cards from decklists
  which will only return those matching cards.
- Added the ability to specify the collector number of the card when reading cards from decklists

0.9.4 --> 0.9.5
- Added the 'promo' and 'promo_types' attributes for scryfall cards

0.9.5 --> 0.9.6
- Fixed a Scryfall updating error
- Added a bulk update option for Scryfall
- Added many new attributes for scryfall cards and sets
- Fixed an error with an incorrect warnings.warn parameter when reading
  a decklist from string
